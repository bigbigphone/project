# project
The project idea is to optimise the management process of a commodity inventory system of a chain store of retailing by being a clearing house of the commodity inflow to and outflow from the store on a routine basis, e.g. daily. The system will include basic features which consist of a search filter of stocks, insert, delete and update information. Status of the inventory system is automatically changed and out-of-stock alerts are delivered when the quantitiy of stocks becomes zero because of a reduction or an update. Additionally, a stock-dispatching function is implemented for better management of the commodity.

When the program is being run, user will be asked to input relevant number in order to execute respective commands. Then  information related to the commodity will be requested to input, which includes words and numbers. The detailed functionalites of this program are to search information of a stock, insert datas when there are new commodity or refill of current commodity, delete datas when the commodity is sold, dumped or internally dispatched, update new or accurate information of the stock when necessary and dispatch the commodity when it is available in other stores. The processed information will be printed on screen as an output.
